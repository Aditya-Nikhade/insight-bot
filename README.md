# Insight Bot

## Why I made this project:

In warehouses or stores, data lives in SQL databases ‚Äî but staff may not know SQL or have time to write queries. For example, a store manager might want to ask, 'How many quantities of X were sold?' 
I built an AI-powered system to solve this: a regex-based filter blocks irrelevant queries, Redis handles caching for performance, and a secure SQL generator (with injection protection) converts natural language into accurate queries along with tabular data visualisation if possible. 

The result is a safe, intuitive web interface that turns casual questions into database insights ‚Äî no technical knowledge needed!

## Features

- üß† **AI-powered natural language to SQL conversion**
- üîí **Read-only, secure SQL execution** (SQL injection protection, only SELECTs allowed)
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Self-healing:** auto-corrects invalid SQL queries
- üìä **Chart suggestions** for visualizing results
- ‚ö° **Fast responses** with Redis caching
- üê≥ **Easy deployment** with Docker

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set environment variables** (see below)

## Required Environment Variables

Set these in a `.env` file or your environment:

- `DATABASE_URL` ‚Äî SQLAlchemy DB URL (e.g., `mysql+mysqlconnector://user:pass@host:port/db`)
- `REDIS_HOST` and `REDIS_PORT` ‚Äî Redis connection info (default: `localhost:6379`)
- `AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT` ‚Äî Azure OpenAI endpoint
- `AI_TOKEN` ‚Äî Azure OpenAI API key

## Running the Application

### Using Docker
```bash
docker build -t insight-bot .
docker run -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env insight-bot
```

### Without Docker
```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

Open your browser to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and ask questions like:
- ‚ÄúShow me the top 5 products by sales.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúHow many customers signed up last month?‚Äù

The bot will generate a SQL query, run it, and display the results (with a chart if possible).

## API

### POST `/query`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "question": "List the top 5 products by sales",
  "conversation_id": "optional-uuid"
}
```
**Response:**
```json
{
  "sql_query": "...",
  "results": [...],
  "chart_suggestion": {...},
  "conversation_id": "..."
}
```

## Project Structure

- `app.py` ‚Äî Main application file
- `templates/` ‚Äî HTML templates
- `Dockerfile` ‚Äî Docker configuration
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äî Project dependencies
- `schema.sql` ‚Äî Example database schema

## Security

- Only SELECT queries are allowed; all others are blocked with a cheeky message.
- SQL injection is prevented by strict validation and cleaning of all AI-generated SQL.
